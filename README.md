# open-geolens

Open GeoLens is an open-source geo-spatial data analysis tool that focuses on location based "well-being".

This tool is to provide a comprehensive and intuitive view of the "well-being" in a given region. By analyzing the infrastructure and amenities available within a geographical boundary, this tool can correlate the HDI and happiness factors to provide a more accurate picture of "well-being". The tool will enable sustainable development initiatives to identify areas for improvement and help businesses to find best places to expand their services.

Human Development Index (HDI) is a widely used measure to assess the quality of life in different regions of the world. HDI is calculated based on three factors, namely life expectancy, education, and income. However, HDI alone may not provide a complete picture of the "well-being" in a given region. So, happiness is another important factor that we are using in this project.

This tool uses data from the OpenStreetMap project, which provides a vast amount of geographical data.
